/# just i am showing the error on Toasts for test only we can replace this toasts with any other thing like new page , pop up etcâ€¦. #/

ALL Handled test cases

No connection

Connection time out

Parsing error (wrong data came from server)

Server error 

Zero friends coming from server

Only load data once and use when user switch between the two pages

Refresh the current page which user last selected  

Make sure that i have data before go to the page (avoid passing null data)

Prevent pressing many times on refresh button (just one click then wait until connect to server finish)

Map crashes when move to mapPage fragment then back then go to it again

Set items to middle in the list include when the user click on the first and the last items what about if only 1 item also handled

Runtime permissions added for call and location

Check if user enabled the location

What about if he enabled then disabled again i will ask for it too also if device GPS have problem i tell the user to try to reopen it

Used google server to get the distance to take in consider the routes not just do it with Math 

Check for wrong number may be some friend added wrong number by mistake it can crash the app (also backend should handle it)

Same thing with E-mail may be some one add wrong e-mail (also backend should handle it)

Sending message check if user typed empty message also prevent him from press on send button many times at once
